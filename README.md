# Thesis skeleton
In this project you can find an easy to start with LaTeX skeleton for a bachelor / master thesis.

The skeleton includes many standard packages and a lot of comments in the main source file [thesis/thesis.tex](https://github.com/joernhees/thesis-skeleton/blob/master/thesis/thesis.tex).
I also wrote down some tips about structuring the thesis in the example [thesis/thesis.pdf](https://github.com/joernhees/thesis-skeleton/raw/master/thesis/thesis.pdf). 

Originally, the skeleton was developed for students of the University of Kaiserslautern, but its very easy to adapt it to other institutions. It's an English template by default, but can easily be switched to German. Also it's possible to have English and German abstracts side by side as required by some universities in Germany.

Feedback / updates welcome at any time.
