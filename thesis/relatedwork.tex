\chapter{Related Work}\label{chap:relatedWork}
	This is an important chapter and it is different from Chapter~\ref{chap:Foundations}.
	
	While you focus on what things a reader should know to understand your work in the previous chapter, this chapter focuses on previous work which is (very) close to the problem you want to solve.
	
	Maybe previous authors nearly solved the problem you want to solve or maybe they solved in a different way.
	Mention such works here (e.g., \cite{Bush1945}) and tell the reader what makes your work special.
	Show the \underline{differences}, how is your approach better or worse?
	
	
	\section{Field A}
		If you're combining works from several fields, why not structure them into Sections?
	
	\section{Field B}
		And another field.
