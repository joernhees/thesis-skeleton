\chapter{Mainpart}
	This is just a dummy chapter for all the main chapters of your thesis, so the actual content of your work.
	
	Usually it's a poor choice to just have one main chapter and a huge number of sections.
	Also you don't name the Mainpart Mainpart, give these chapters speaking names.
	Remember Section~\ref{sec:structure}.
