\chapter{Foundations}\label{chap:Foundations}
	A chapter for (mathematical) foundations and background knowledge your audience will need.
	
	\section{What Belongs Here?}
	While writing this section usually teaches you a lot (as you have to explain the concepts you are using), keep in mind that this is \underline{not} your actual work.
	This chapter should be as short as possible, brushing up on things which are essential for your work.
	
	\section{What Does Not}
	Do not forget that your reader usually is a computer scientist, so please do not re-explain too simple things here.
