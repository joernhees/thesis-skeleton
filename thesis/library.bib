@Misc{ Bush1945,
	annote = {A newspaper article at the end of world war 2 about new tasks for scientists after the war. Facing a "growing mountain of research", too many papers to read, "publication has been extended far beyond our present ability to make real use of the record". Proposes application of technology, mainly wrt. camera techniques, microfilmes etc. "The Encyclopedia Britannica could be reduced to the volume of a matchbox."..."Mere compression, of course, is not enough; one needs not only to make and store a record but also to be able to consult it". Ref. to speech recognition "Vocoder" (Bell Labs) inverse. Computers getting faster and faster... "A mathematician is not a man who can readily manipulate figures;often he cannot. He is not even a man who can readily perform the transformation of equations by the use of calculus. He is primarily an individual who is skilled in the use of symbolic logic on a high plane, and especially he is a man of intuitive judgment in the choice of the manipulative processes he employs." Describes search in data, automatic warehouse management systems, then gets to one of the most visionary things: Artificial indexing (alphabetically, numerical) doesn't work, it should be more like the human mind: "The human mind does not work that way. It operates by association. With one item in its grasp, it snaps instantly to the next that is suggested by the association of thoughts, in accordance with some intricate web of trails carried by the cells of the brain. It has other characteristics, of course; trails that are not frequently followed are prone to fade, items are not fully permanent, memory is transitory. Yet the speed of action, the intricacy of trails, the detail of mental pictures, is awe-inspiring beyond all else in nature. Man cannot hope fully to duplicate this mental process artificially, but he certainly ought to be able to learn from it. In minor ways he may even improve, for his records have relative permanency. The first idea, however, to be drawn from the analogy concerns selection. Selection by association, rather than by indexing, may yet be mechanized. One cannot hope thus to equal the speed and flexibility with which the mind follows an associative trail, but it should be possible to beat the mind decisively in regard to the permanence and clarity of the items resurrected from storage. Consider a future device for individual use, which is a sort of mechanized private file and library. It needs a name, and to coin one at random, ``memex'' will do. A memex is a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory." Associative browsing, inserting thoughts and making such thought trails permanent and easily refindable, even after years. "Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready-made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified." },
