This is a skeleton of my master thesis.
It includes a quite common structure and some details on how to use it in the Introduction.

On this page you can see an abstract.
It shall be short (max. 1 page) and give an uninterested reader a clue what this whole work is about.
Why do you think your work is needed?
What is your main contribution?

Again: make it short!
